# YagaTalk - Automated AI Assistant Platform

## Overview

YagaTalk is an innovative platform that empowers businesses to effortlessly create, integrate, and deploy AI assistants to enhance customer engagement and communication. It allows business owners to design and configure chatbots in a free-text manner, just like teaching a future employee how to interact with customers. YagaTalk offers two principal delivery methods: embedding the bot as an iframe on the business website and providing it as a Telegram bot accessible via a link.

## Key features

**Natural Language Configuration**. YagaTalk allows business owners to define their AI assistant's communication style and content using natural language. No technical expertise is required.

**Multi-Delivery Options**. YagaTalk offers flexible deployment options, enabling businesses to integrate chatbots seamlessly into their websites or leverage Telegram for broader accessibility.

## Basic User Flow

**Configuration**. Users access the YagaTalk admin console to create and configure their chatbot. They define the bot's communication style, responses, and any secret information to be revealed during interactions.

**Testing & Deployment**. After configuring the chatbot, users can test its performance in a real-time environment. Once satisfied, they deploy it to their website or as a Telegram bot.

**Monitoring & Analytics**. YagaTalk provides real-time monitoring and analytics through the admin console. Users can track the bot's performance, view conversation history, and make adjustments as needed.

## Usage examples

### Scenario 1. English Teacher Empowering Students

**Benefit Owner**: English teacher

**Participants**: English teacher, students

An English teacher configures a chat-based quiz for their students as homework using YagaTalk. The teacher defines conversation topics and prepares secret information to be revealed during the interaction. Students engage with the bot, practicing their English fluency. The teacher can access the admin console to evaluate students' progress, identify areas for improvement, and provide feedback. The teacher and students benefit from enhanced language learning experiences.

### Scenario 2. Business Providing Information

**Benefit Owner**: Small business owner

**Participants**: Business owner, customers

A small business owner uses YagaTalk to create an AI assistant that provides information about product prices, office addresses, and other frequently asked questions. The AI assistant is embedded as an iframe on the business website. Customers can easily access the information they need by conversing with the bot. The business owner benefits from improved customer service and reduced support inquiries, while customers enjoy quick and convenient access to information.


In both scenarios, YagaTalk empowers users to easily create and deploy chatbots that serve their specific needs, providing a valuable tool for effective communication and automation, tailored to the user's unique goals and requirements.
